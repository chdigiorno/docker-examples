# Without the entrypoint sample in this repository, after setting up the app, we would have to do all of this manually:

docker-compose exec web bash  # Get inside web's container
cd django_in_docker_example_with_compose

# Run migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create a Django superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Check that the superuser is in the database
Alternative 1:
	exit  # Get out of web's container to enter db's
	docker-compose exec db bash  # Get inside db's container
	psql -U postgres  # Enter postgres
	select * from auth_user;  # This should show the created superuser
Alternative 2:
	apt-get update
	apt-get install postgresql-client  # Install postgres' client to access the database from this container
	psql -h db -U postgres
	select * from auth_user;

# And NOW we run the runserver command...
